      <h1>About coffee</h1>
      <h2>From the Wikipedia coffee page</h2>
      <h3>What is coffee and how to prepare it</h3>
      <p class="first">
        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds
        of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds
        are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.
        The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a
        consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles
        that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out,
        producing a cup of coffee.

        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating
        effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of
        the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented
        in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or
        already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although
        chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or
        cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
        It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like
        doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee
        beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch
        coffeeshops selling cannabis).

      <h3>Benefits of coffee</h3>
      <p class="first">
        Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign
        or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing
        research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some
        diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable
        credibility.
      </p>
      <p class="second">
        The earliest credible evidence of the drinking of coffee in the form of
        the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the
        15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and
        brewed in a manner similar to current methods. The Yemenis procured the
        coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
        intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had
        reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to
        Europe.

      <h3>Coffee <em>cultivars</em> and market</h3>
      <p class="first">
        The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C.
        robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in
        the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian
        subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of
        coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[6] Coffee is a major
        export commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous
        countries. It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by
        developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded
        agricultural commodity and the most traded commodity overall, second
        only to petroleum. Despite the sales of coffee reaching billions of
        dollars, those actually producing the beans are disproportionately
        living in poverty. Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative
        impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing
        and water use. The environmental costs and wage disparity of farmers are
        causing the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.
